# Trading&Consulting App
Web application for trading and consulting activities


## Getting Started
Download the project.

You need an IDE for java coding (eclipse,STS...).

It's a spring boot project so you don't need to install any web container.


## Deployment
Run the principle class "SpringFinanceApplication" as a "java application".

So the web is running on the port 8081 (http://localhost:8081).

This port could be changed from "application.properties" file.
